# Knights Travails

[Knights travails](./src/knightController.js) implemented with JavaScript.

This project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails) curriculum.

## How to Use

This project will show the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way using BFS.

- ``knightMoves(start, end)`` will return an array which is the shortest path.

- The parameters **start** and **end** are arrays that indicate the coordinates **[x, y]**
