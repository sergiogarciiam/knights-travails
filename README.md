# Knights Travails

Knights travails implemented with JavaScript.

This project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails) curriculum.

## How to Use

This project will show the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way using BFS.

- ``new knightMoves(start, end)`` will return a object which has the number of moves and the path.

- start and end are arrays that indicate the coordinates.
